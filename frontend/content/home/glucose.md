Currently my blood glucose is above average and is trending down by 6 points.
A person without Type 1 Diabetes has an average blood glucose reading of 120. The graphic shows whether I am above, below, or at average.
Using MongoDB and a Python Microservice API, I am able to retrieve real time data regarding my current glucose reading. I hope to develop analytics and insights into glucose readings to help Type I Diabetics better manage their Diabetes.
